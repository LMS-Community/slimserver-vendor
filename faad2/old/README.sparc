To build faad on ReadyNAS sparc, the libfaad/Makefile needs to be changed to remove the use of -iquote which is not
available in the version of gcc on ReadyNAS.  Replace -iquote with -I.

You also want to add -DFIXED_POINT -DPADRE to the configure command to build the fixed-point version as well as Padre-specific ASM.
